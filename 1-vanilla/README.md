# Vanilla

This is an implementation of Four Dots using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## First 15 minutes.

I was able to layout initial HTML, connect a CSS file, and connect a JavaScript file within 15 minutes.

Bugs and Improvements:

- Instrument all of the buttons with onclick event handlers.
- Use CSS to center content on the page.
- Doesn't support mobile layouts. Add responsive design.
- Styling of the board is lacking. Delineate between cells.
- Missing examples of Red and White dots.
- Generic button styles are boring.
- Missing game state management.
